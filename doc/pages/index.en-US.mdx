## Overview [#overview]

```ts
import { Earth } from "dde-earth";
import { TIFFLayerLoader } from "@dde-earth/plugin-tiff-loader";

const earth = new Earth("container");

// Use plugin, load tiff
earth.usePlugin(new TIFFLayerLoader());

earth.addLayer({
  url: "./tiff.tiff",
  method: "tiff",
  renderOptions: {
    single: {
      colorScale: "rainbow",
    },
  },
});
```
In this example, after initializing the earth in one line of code, by adding the `TIFFLayerLoader` plugin, the `earth` has the ability to load `tiff`.

The complete TypeScript mechanism makes **dde-earth** have intelligent code hints. Developers will find that they have a `tiff` type layer when they call the `addLayer` method.

## Features [#features]

With just one line of code, you can save a lot of packaging work for cesium in your project and immediately have the following incredible features:

- Lightweight (core package gzip compressed to only **3.9kb**)
- Supports rapid **expansion** of earth capabilities through plugins
- Supports **TypeScript**
- Supports multiple languages
- Layer management
- Terrain management
- Built-in event subscription (layer addition, layer removal, layer rendering, language switch, terrain switch…)
- Layer operations (zoom, render)
- …

In addition, the official provides a wealth of plugins to choose from:

- Mouse event subscription
- Layer order swap
- Basic layer loading (tms, wmts, wms, arcgis)
- GeoJson loading and rendering
- Mapbox vector tile loading and rendering
- NetCDF loading and rendering
- TIFF loading and rendering
- Navigation tools
- …
